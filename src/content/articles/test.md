_Earlier this year I started a PhD in pure mathematics at KU Leuven in Belgium and in this blog post I discuss my research workflow._

## LaTeX Notes 

### dcfas
Doing a PhD in mathematics, it makes most sense to take notes in LaTeX...

## Reference Management
Doing research means dealing with a lot of references to papers and books...


$$
  \theta = \max_{\theta} p(\mathbf{x}_1, \dots, \mathbf{x}_N | \theta) ~~~~~ (1)
  
$$
$$
 p(\mathbf {X} | \mu , \sigma ^2) = \prod_{n=1}^{N} \mathcal{N}(x_{n}|\mu,\sigma^2)
$$
